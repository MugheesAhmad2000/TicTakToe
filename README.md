# TicTakToe

## Description:
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. The program allows two players to take turns marking cells on a 3x3 board until a winner is determined or the game ends in a draw.

The main features of the program include:

Game Logic: The code implements the game logic, including checking for a winning combination of marks and detecting a draw condition.

Player Turns: The program alternates between player turns, allowing each player to input their desired cell coordinates to mark their respective symbol (Player 1: 'O' and Player 2: 'X') on the board.

AI Opponent: The program also includes a simple AI opponent that automatically selects its moves based on the available cells on the board. The AI opponent aims to prevent the human player from winning and attempts to secure a win if possible.

Visual Board Representation: The code displays the current state of the board after each move, providing a visual representation using underscore ('_') for empty cells, 'O' for Player 1's moves, and 'X' for Player 2's moves.

The implementation aims to provide an interactive and enjoyable Tic-Tac-Toe gaming experience. Feel free to explore, modify, or enhance the code to suit your specific requirements or experiment with different AI strategies. Have fun playing the game!
